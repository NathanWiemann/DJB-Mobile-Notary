    <p>Heading to a notary appointment in Reading, PA? Whether you're finalizing a real estate transaction, verifying identity documents, or signing a power of attorney, being prepared can make all the difference. Here's what you need to bring to ensure your notarization process goes smoothly.</p>

    <h2>Valid Government-Issued Photo ID</h2>
    <p>The most important thing to bring is valid identification. Pennsylvania notaries must verify your identity, so bring a government-issued photo ID such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Driver’s license</li>
      <li>State ID card</li>
      <li>U.S. passport</li>
      <li>Military ID</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure your ID is current and matches the name on your documents.</p>

    <h2>The Documents to Be Notarized</h2>
    <p>Bring all pages of the document you need notarized. Do not sign anything beforehand—your notary must witness your signature in most cases. If you're unsure whether the document needs to be signed in front of the notary, ask ahead of time.</p>

    <h2>Any Additional Signers</h2>
    <p>If your document requires multiple signatures, all signers must be present with their own valid ID. The notary must verify each individual’s identity and witness all signatures.</p>

    <h2>Payment Method</h2>
    <p>Notary services may charge a fee based on the type of document and number of signatures. Bring a payment method accepted by your notary—cash, check, or card. It’s a good idea to confirm acceptable forms of payment before your appointment.</p>

    <h2>Special Instructions or Forms</h2>
    <p>Some notarizations, such as affidavits or powers of attorney, may have specific legal language or forms that must be used. If the organization requesting the notarized document gave you instructions or templates, bring them with you.</p>
