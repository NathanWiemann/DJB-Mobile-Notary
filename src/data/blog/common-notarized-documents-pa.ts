    <p>Notarization might not be something you think about every day, but when you need it, knowing which documents typically require it can make the process easier. Whether you're handling personal matters, real estate transactions, or legal forms in Berks County, these are the five most commonly notarized documents in Pennsylvania—and why they matter.</p>

    <h2>1. Power of Attorney (POA)</h2>
    <p>A Power of Attorney allows someone else to make decisions on your behalf—often related to finances or healthcare. Pennsylvania law generally requires POAs to be notarized to ensure authenticity and protect against fraud. The notary will verify your identity and witness your signature.</p>

    <h2>2. Real Estate Transfers & Deeds</h2>
    <p>Whether you're buying, selling, or transferring property, real estate documents like deeds and mortgage forms must be notarized before filing with the county. The notary’s seal gives these documents the legal validity needed for recording with local authorities.</p>

    <h2>3. Wills, Living Wills & Health Care Directives</h2>
    <p>While not always legally required, notarizing wills and healthcare directives adds an extra layer of credibility and can streamline probate or end-of-life decisions. A notary can ensure that all signatures are voluntary and properly witnessed.</p>

    <h2>4. Affidavits & Sworn Statements</h2>
    <p>Affidavits are written statements made under oath. They’re commonly used in legal, school, or government settings. Because they carry legal weight, notarization is required to confirm the signer’s identity and intent.</p>

    <h2>5. Business Forms & Contract Addenda</h2>
    <p>Business agreements, leasing contracts, and loan-related forms often need to be notarized to ensure enforceability. Having a notary present helps confirm that all parties are signing willingly and with full understanding of the terms.</p>

    <h2>Why Notary Access on Sundays Matters</h2>
