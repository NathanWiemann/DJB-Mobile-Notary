    <p>When time is critical and circumstances are sensitive, DJB Notary is here to help. I now provide mobile hospital notary services throughout Berks County, including Reading Hospital, St. Joseph Medical Center, and local rehabilitation or long-term care facilities. Whether it's a power of attorney, healthcare directive, or other important paperwork, I can come directly to the hospital room—promptly and professionally.</p>

    <h2>Why Hospital Notarizations Matter</h2>
    <p>Legal and medical decisions often need to be made quickly in a hospital setting. From advance directives and living wills to powers of attorney and guardianship documents, having a notary available on-site ensures critical documents are legally recognized without delay. I aim to ease the process by offering timely, mobile support right at the bedside.</p>

    <h2>Common Hospital Documents I Notarize</h2>
    <p>My mobile hospital notary services cover a wide range of documents, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Power of attorney (POA)</li>
      <li>Advance healthcare directives and living wills</li>
      <li>Guardianship or custodial documents</li>
      <li>Consent and release forms</li>
      <li>Insurance-related authorizations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I always take special care to confirm the signer is alert, aware, and acting voluntarily—an essential step in hospital notarizations.</p>

    <h2>Compassionate and Professional Service</h2>
    <p>As the owner and operator of DJB Notary, I understand that notarizing a document in a hospital can be an emotional and sensitive task. I approach every appointment with empathy, patience, and professionalism. I also respect privacy and coordinate with hospital staff and family members to ensure a smooth, respectful process.</p>
